I'm a PhD student working on computational materials science at Boston University. Since computational materials is a huge field, it typically helps I also tell you that I work on nanoscale optical and other 'energetically nearby' linear response properties.

My work uses density functional theory, the GW (it's not an acronym) approximation, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Depending on the physics that needs to be modeled, I also work with phonons and how they interact with electrons.
