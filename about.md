I am a research engineer working on computational and surrogate methods in atomistic materials simulation. Since computational materials is a huge field, I will also dabble in nearby technical areas.

My work uses density functional theory and general atomistic surrogate modeling methods to try and find out whatever we may want to find out about atomistic-scale systems with a focus on using smaller resource amounts than is assumed to be necessary.
